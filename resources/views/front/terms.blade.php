                            The accommodation agreement shall be established when the hotel accepts the application set forth in the preceding paragraph. However, this does not apply when the hotel proves it has not accepted the application.
                            When an accommodation agreement has been established as per the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the guest must pay a deposit set by the hotel by the deadline designated by the hotel.
                            The deposit shall first be allocated to room charges ultimately payable by the guest, then allocated to fines followed by compensation for damages in the event that the provisions of Articles 6 and 21 apply; any remaining deposit shall be returned at the time of payment in accordance with Article 13.
                            The accommodation agreement shall cease to be effective when the guest fails to pay the deposit set forth in Paragraph 2 by the deadline designated by the hotel. However, this is limited to cases in which the hotel notifies guests of a deposit deadline.                        </p>
